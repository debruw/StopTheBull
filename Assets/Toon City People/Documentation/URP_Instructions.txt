Added URP compatibility from 2019.3 and later.


When importing the pack in a URP project, open the "URP_Install_Toon City People" file from the project hierarchy.
Then replace the renderer in the pipeline asset with the "TCP_Toon_URP_Renderer" file, which you can find in the Renderer folder.

(you can find the pipeline asset in Edit/Project Settings/Graphics)

Renderer settings:
You might want to check the "Depth Texture" and "Opaque Texture" boxes just in case there are some custom shaders coming in the next updates.
