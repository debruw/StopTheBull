Thank you for purchasing Toon City People!

Version 1.0

There are two types of prefabs for characters:

The Prefab Source folders:

	Those contain all templates for the characters.
	Those prefabs have "Fatness Levels" scripts, which let you control each character's fat levels, through blendshapes.
	Also contained, are scripts that allow you to quickly choose customization items for the characters.
	This way, it's very easy to create a unique character prefab in a matter of seconds.

The Prefab Variations folders:

	In these folders you can find pre-made variations for the characters (5 variations for each template).

*the item customizer script will trigger a warning in the console, but you can ignore it and clear the console when you have finished using it.


The rig setup is Mecanim compatible and should work with any animation pack that uses the same system.
The only animations included in this pack are some idle animations that have been used in the promotional materials.

In addition, there are some extra props included, to add more variety to the characters.

* If you like the pack, please review it :) *
